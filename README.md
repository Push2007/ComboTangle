## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** Swift, Xcode

Through the simple use of integers, strings, and color, I was able to create a 3x3 grid of squares, where each square consisted of a color, shape, and number. I tracked the data of each square using a tuple, and these tuples 
are constantly updated whenever a player makes a move, the board is reset, or the player creates a new game. I am now working on creating a new level, where the user has to simulatneously complete 2 combinations.

## Lessons Learned:

This was my first project on Xcode, so I learned a lot about the basics of Swift. I learned how to use VStacks, HStacks, ZStacks, Colors, Shapes, Numbers, Pickers, and Buttons for my UI. The UI is made colorful to attract
the attention of children. I learned how to debug and use the iPhone simulator for testing purposes. I learned how to use navigation links to take users to different screens of the app. Most importantly, I learned how to create
a full functioning app, distribute it to App Store Connect, and successfully have it published on to the iOS App Store.
